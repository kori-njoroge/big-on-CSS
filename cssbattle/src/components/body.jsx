                <p>This course is not there to replace other learning methods. Yes, you can learn CSS for free. But our course is altogether a different experience where you don't have to watch multiple videos or read long articles/documentation to learn. You just sit back, play and learn by doing along the way - hopefully at a much better speed and with more knowledge retention compared to other methods. üôÇ</p>

                <p>The cost is just for that new & different experience to learn CSS!</p>

                        <p>‚ÄúA very interactive course compared to those available from other providers, which feel more like lectures. With an interactive and in-browser embedded coding environment, what more could you ask for? I highly recommend this course to beginners or even coders with some experience who are trying to get back into CSS!‚Äù   </p>
